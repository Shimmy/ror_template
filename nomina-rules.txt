Rules for Rails App Development

Project Context
* This is a Ruby on Rails application.
* Your base directory is the root of the Rails app.

Scaffolding
* Use the custom generator: rails generate scaffold_with_associations.
* It automatically adds has_many in the associated model when using references.
* Prefer this generator over the default.
* When generating scaffolds, use references where applicable. If unsure, ask the user.
* Do not remove or alter existing functionality unless explicitly told.

Routing
* Use restful routing with resources
* nest resources when applicable, for example
  resources :blogs do
    resources :ratings
  end

JavaScript (Stimulus)
* Use Stimulus for all frontend interactions.
* Do not add inline JavaScript in HTML.
* Place controllers in app/javascript/controllers/
* Name files like: [controller_name_plural]_controller.js.

Stylesheets (Tailwind)
* All views have tailwind css loaded
* Always use tailwind, don't create inline css.
* Try to keep the same layout and style as existing views.

Conventions & Principles
* Stick to Rails conventions unless user instructs otherwise.
* Avoid over-engineering.
* When modifying or adding code, preserve all existing functionality unless told to refactor.

Preinstalled components
* Rails Authenticator is installed
* Current.user and Current.user.id to get the current user
* authenticated? to check if user is authenticated
* User model is the preinstalled user model, you can not modify it.

Common Commands
* rails generate scaffold_with_associations
* rails db:migrate
* rails db:rollback

Troubleshooting
* When user says something went wrong please check the rails development log
* located in log/development.log
* you probably should not read the whole log since it can be really big
* tail -n50 log/development.log shoud be sufficient if you dont know what you are looking for
* You can also grep the log
